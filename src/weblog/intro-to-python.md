### Introduction
Python, a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language, has gained immense popularity among developers worldwide. Known for its simplicity and readability, Python offers a powerful yet accessible toolset that makes programming a joy for beginners and experienced programmers alike. In this blog post, we will explore the fundamentals of Python and showcase a few examples of how Python code can be used to solve real-world problems. Get ready to embark on an exciting journey into the world of Python!

### Python: An Introduction
Python, created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. Its intuitive syntax and extensive standard library make it an ideal choice for tasks ranging from web development to data analysis, machine learning, and more. Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and simplicity, allowing programmers to express their ideas with clear and concise code.

Hello, World! - Your First Python Program:
Let's dive into Python by writing the classic "Hello, World!" program. Open a text editor and enter the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello_world.py`). Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the file, and execute the program by running python hello_world.py. Voila! You have successfully run your first Python program.

### Solving Problems with Python
Python's versatility shines when it comes to problem-solving. Here are a few examples to showcase its capabilities:

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
| Cell 7   | Cell 8   | Cell 9   |


**1. Mathematical Operations:**
Python can handle complex mathematical operations with ease. For instance, let's calculate the area of a circle:

```python
import math

radius = 5
area = math.pi * radius ** 2

print("The area of the circle is:", area)
```

**2. File Handling:**
Python simplifies file handling tasks. Here's an example that reads a text file and counts the number of lines:

```python
file_path = "example.txt"
line_count = 0

with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        line_count += 1

print("Number of lines in the file:", line_count)
```

```javascript
function calculateRectangleArea(length, width) {
  if (length <= 0 || width <= 0) {
    return 'Invalid dimensions. Length and width must be greater than 0.';
  }

  return length * width;
}

// Example usage
const length = 5;
const width = 3;
const area = calculateRectangleArea(length, width);
console.log('Area of the rectangle:', area);
````

**3. Web Scraping:**
Python's libraries make web scraping a breeze. Here's a simple script that extracts titles from a web page using the requests and beautifulsoup4 libraries:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://www.example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

titles = soup.find_all('h2')

for title in titles:
    print(title.text)
```

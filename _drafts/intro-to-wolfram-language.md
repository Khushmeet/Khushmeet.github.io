# Introduction
Around 30 years ago (28 years to be correct), on june 23, 1988 **Mathematica** software was released, 
by Wolfram Research. Founded by Stephen Wolfram, physicist and technologist. 
It is a mathematical symbolic computational programming software siilar to MATLAB. 
The language it uses is known as **Wolfram Language**.
It comes packed with Mathematica and the current version is 11.

Wolfram Language is a multi-paradigm symbolic language similar to LISP, meaning code and data are alike. 
You can manipulate the code the same way you do for data and this makes language very powerfull.
It is a high level language higher than most mainstream languages.
There are builtin functions for almost everything ranging from geography to linguistics to audio. 
Just look at its vastness.

You can even access your facebook data and manipulate and analyse it.
There is so much that can be done.
I will try to demonstrate some amazing things that it enables you to do as we go along.
Pretty visualizations are there to help you make most of the data.
All the functions are well documented and hence its easy to do a lot more with only a few lines of code.

Lets start with the basics of how language works and them we will move on to more complex examples.

# Basics
Everything in Wolfram Language is a function. But first start with usual arithmetic.
